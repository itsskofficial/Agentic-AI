# Agentic AI Roadmap

### 1\. **Prerequisites:**

*   **Strong Python Proficiency:**
    *   Master Python, including asynchronous programming (`asyncio`).
    *   Be comfortable working with APIs (e.g., using `requests` or `httpx`) and handling JSON data.
*   **Conceptual Foundations:**
    *   Understand basic linear algebra concepts, especially vectors and vector similarity (cosine similarity).
    *   Grasp fundamental probability concepts to understand how language models generate text.

### 2\. **LLM Fundamentals:**

*   **Core LLM Concepts:**
    *   Learn about the Transformer architecture at a high level.
    *   Understand key terms: tokens, context window, embeddings, and temperature.
*   **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Master the art of writing effective prompts to guide LLM behavior.
    *   Learn about few-shot prompting, role-playing, and structured output formats (like JSON).

### 3\. **Introduction to Agentic AI:**

*   **Agent Fundamentals:**
    *   Understand what an AI Agent is and how it differs from a simple LLM call.
    *   Learn the core agent loop: **Observation -> Thought -> Action -> Observation**.
    *   Grasp key reasoning frameworks like **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**.

### 4\. **Core Agent Components:**

*   **Planning and Reasoning:**
    *   Explore how agents break down complex goals into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Understand how an LLM acts as the "reasoning engine" or "brain" of the agent.
*   **Tool Use (Function Calling):**
    *   Learn how to give agents "tools" by defining functions they can call.
    *   Implement agents that can interact with external APIs, databases, or local files.
*   **Memory:**
    *   Differentiate between short-term memory (context window) and long-term memory.
    *   Learn about **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB) for persistent knowledge.

### 5\. **Building with Agentic Frameworks:**

*   **Learn a Core Framework:**
    *   Dive deep into a popular agent framework like **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, or **Ingest**.
    *   Understand their core abstractions: Chains, Agent Executors, Routers, and Toolkits.
*   **Implement Your First Agent:**
    *   Build a simple, tool-using agent (e.g., a weather bot that calls a weather API).
    *   Create a RAG-based agent that can answer questions about your own documents.

### 6\. **Advanced Architectures:**

*   **Multi-Agent Systems:**
    *   Explore architectures where multiple agents collaborate to solve a problem.
    *   Learn about frameworks like **AutoGen** or **CrewAI** that facilitate agent-to-agent communication.
    *   Understand different roles agents can play (e.g., Planner, Executor, Critic).
*   **Self-Correction and Reflection:**
    *   Study techniques where an agent can critique its own work and iteratively improve its output.
    *   Implement loops where one agent generates a plan or code, and another agent reviews and provides feedback.

### 7\. **Evaluation and Observability:**

*   **Testing Your Agents:**
    *   Learn how to evaluate an agent's performance beyond simple accuracy.
    *   Focus on metrics like task completion rate, cost, latency, and robustness.
*   **Observability Tools:**
    *   Use tools like **LangSmith**, **Arize AI**, or custom logging to trace an agent's thoughts and actions.
    *   Debug failing agent runs by inspecting the full chain of reasoning and tool calls.

### 8\. **Advanced Projects:**

*   **Code Generation Agent:**
    *   Build an agent that can write, read, and modify files in a sandboxed environment (similar to the Vibe project).
*   **Automated Research Assistant:**
    *   Create an agent that can browse the web, summarize articles, and compile a research report on a given topic.

### 9\. **Capstone Project:**

*   **Build a "Mini-Automaton":**
    *   Design a multi-agent system to accomplish a complex, multi-step task from start to finish.
    *   Example: An agent that takes a business idea, performs market research, drafts a basic business plan, and generates a simple landing page for it.

### 10\. **Practical Tips:**

*   **Explore Open Source Agents:**
    *   Study the code of popular open-source agent projects like **OpenDevin** or **Open Interpreter**.
    *   Contribute to these projects to gain practical experience.
*   **Continuous Learning:**
    *   The field is moving at an incredible pace. Follow key researchers and labs on social media and arXiv.
    *   Stay updated on new agentic frameworks, reasoning techniques, and evaluation methods.
